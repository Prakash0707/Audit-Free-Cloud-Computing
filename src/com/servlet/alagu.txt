There have been many attempts to design encryption protocols that can be used to implement secure
multiparty computation against an adaptive adversary. The rst protocols by Beaver and Haber [BH92]
required interaction between the sender and receiver, required erasure and were fairly inecient. The
rst non-interactive protocol was given by Canetti, Feige, Goldreich and Naor in [CFGN96]. In [CFGN96]
the authors dened a new primitive called Non-Committing Encryption, and gave an example of such a
scheme based on the RSA assumption. In [Bea97], Beaver extended the work of [CFGN96], and created
adaptively secure key exchange under the Die-Hellman assumption. In subsequent work, Damgard and
Nielsen improved the eciency of the schemes of Canetti et al. and Beaver, they were also able to obtain
Non-Committing Encryption based on one-way trapdoor functions with invertible sampling. In [CHK05],
Canetti, Halevi and Katz presented a Non-Committing encryption protocols with evolving keys.
In [CDNO97], Canetti, Dwork, Naor and Ostrovsky extended the notion of Non-Committing Encryption
to a new protocol which they called Deniable Encryption. In Non-Committing Encryption schemes
there is a simulator, which can generate non-committing ciphertexts, and later open them to any desired
message, while in Deniable Encryption, valid encryptions generated by the sender and receiver can later
be opened to any desired message. The power of this primitive made it relatively dicult to realize, and
Canetti et al. were only able to obtain modest examples of Deniable Encryption and left it as an open
question whether fully deniable schemes could be created.
The notions of security against an adaptive adversary can also be applied to commitments. In fact,
according to [DNRS03] the necessity of adaptively-secure commitments was realized by 1985. Despite its
utility, until recently, relatively few papers directly addressed the question of commitments secure against
a selective opening adversary (SOA). The work of Dwork, Naor, Reingold and Stockmeyer [DNRS03] was
the rst to explicitly address the problem. In [DNRS03], Dwork et al. showed that non-interactive SOAsecure
commitments can be used to create a 3-round zero-knowledge proof systems for NP with negligible
soundness error, and they gave constructions of a weak form of SOA-secure commitments, but leave open
the question of whether general SOA-secure commitments exist.
